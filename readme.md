# Capstone Project Proposal

Please complete this project proposal thoroughly so that your instructors can review it and have an intelligent conversation with you about requirements, scope, feasiblity, etc. Proposals will be due by the end of day on Friday before capstones start. If you don't have your idea fully fleshed out, complete the portions of this you can so that an instructor can help you flesh out the rest of your idea.

## Project Description
An app that allows bands and promoters to easily book shows.


## Problem Statement
Booking a show for your band with or without a band manager can be very difficult and time consuming. Filling an empty slot for a show as a promoter can also be very difficult and time consuming.

## How will your project solve this problem?
My app will bring both parties together with a simple app that shows what bands are available in a certain city on a certain date.


## 5 user stories (at least):

* As a user, I can add my band with date and location to a list of available bands based on date and location
* As a user, I can see available bands for a given date and location
* As a user, I can navigate from the home page to a "Band Login" or to "Book a Show"
* As a user, I can book a band 
* As a user, I can delete a request to be booked once a promoter books my band
* As a user, I can edit my location if the band decides to go to a different city on the same date

## ERD - Entity Relationship Diagram

This does not need to be your absolute final ERD. We want you thinking about your data and how it might be related. Your ERD can be adjusted as your project progresses.
